# Data-Science-Nigeria-2021-AI-Bootcamp-Qualification-Hackathon-by-Data-Science-Nigeria
This is a hackathon I participated in organized by Data science of Nigeria in Qualification for the 2021 Bootcamp

The data is a structured dataset pull from the sapa.com database with a few important features that can be used to predict customer response to marketing campaigns. The data sample has been split into train and test with a volume of 1568 and 672.

Files available for download

train.csv: contains the target. This is the dataset that you will use to train your model.
test.csv- resembles train.csv but without the target-related columns. This is the dataset on which you will apply your model to.
sample_submission.csv: shows the submission format for this competition, with the ‘ID’ column mirroring that of test.csv and the ‘target’ column containing your predictions. The order of the rows does not matter, but the names of the ID must be correct.
